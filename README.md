  Welcome to this brief tutorial! We will begin by going to portal.azure.com and creating a virtual machine as seen above and you will name it osTicket. A virtual machine in simple terms is a virtual computer within your physical computer and you can run programs on that virtual computer and manipulate it. We use VMs in order to run multiple operations in one physical computer and to save time and cost as well. Once you have created a virtual machine it should also create a bunch of stuff with it like a Resource Group (RG).
